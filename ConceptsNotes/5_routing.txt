Routing: 

Routing is a plugin that is installed into an application to simplify and 
structure the page request handling. It provides a structured way to handle
incoming HTTP requests and generate corresponding responses. 

With Ktor routing, developers can define routes that match specific request URLs 
and methods, and then handle these requests with custom logic.
